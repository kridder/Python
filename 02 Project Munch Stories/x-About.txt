Project Munch Stories (working title)

A local co-op card game where you have to work together to survive as long as possible.

Each player has three rows of cards. In the beginning only the bottom one has cards.

The bottom row represents the player's backpack, and can up to hold 7 weapons.
The middle row represents the player's weapon belt and can hold up to 3 weapons.
The top row represents the player's hands and can hold 1 medium or large weapon, or 2 small weapons.

During combat, the level of the weapon held in each player's hand will count towards the combined combat level of both players
along with their individual player levels. The combined player level must be higher than the combined enemy level to defeat
the enemies.
While in combat players are only allowed to swap weapons between their hands and weapons belt, there will be no time to
access the backpack, so choose loadout wisely.

After each combat there is a chance that the weapons the players used will break and become useless.

In between combat looting will take place to gain extra weapons, and to change the weapons between the belt and the backpack if
desired.
